# library-prototype
This is just a prototype for my library project or it's just a practice field. I'll make some adjustments from day to day.

# LibraryProjectV1
In this version I added some features. These features are:
  *Authentication system
  *Erasing all data button
  *Some adjustments for background picture

In the next version, I am planning to add 'try and except' blocks to control and make sure that the inputs are in the proper level.
So what I want to say is that I don't want a username that includes these signs "∑€®₺¥æß^∆¨¬´Ω≈√". These are not appropriate neither for a username nor for a password.
